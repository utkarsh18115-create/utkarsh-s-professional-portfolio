export const about = `I'm a third-year Electronics and Computer Science student at Shah and Anchor Kutchhi Engineering College, Mumbai. My work sits at the intersection of software development and intelligent systems.

I've built projects ranging from voice AI agents using local LLMs to quantum computing research with industry partners. I'm particularly interested in applying machine learning to real-world problems—whether that's optimizing irrigation with IoT sensors or developing NLP-powered applications.

Currently seeking AI/ML and software development roles where I can contribute to meaningful technical work.`;
